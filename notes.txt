________________________________________________If you want to add more JSON files later, follow these steps:

Steps to Add a New JSON File
1. Create the New JSON File
Place your new JSON file inside the data/ folder.

For example, if you want to add a reviews.json file, create data/reviews.json.

2. Update server.js to Include the New File
Find the following line in server.js:

const files = ["admins", "clients", "designers", "vendors", "products", "projects"];
Add the new file name (reviews in this case) to the array:

const files = ["admins", "clients", "designers", "vendors", "products", "projects", "reviews"];

3. Restart the Server
Run the following command to restart the server:
npm run server
Your new API endpoint will be available at:


http://localhost:5000/reviews
Once you follow these steps, the server will automatically recognize the new JSON file and expose it as an API endpoint. No other changes are needed.
